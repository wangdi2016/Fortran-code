In Fortran, the command-line arguments are accessed through the COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT intrinsic function and the GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT subroutine. These features allow you to retrieve the values passed to the program when it is executed from the command line.

In this example, the program retrieves the number of command-line arguments using COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT() and allocates an array (argValue) of the appropriate size to store the argument values. It then uses the GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT subroutine to retrieve each argument value and its length.

Finally, it prints the command-line arguments using a loop and deallocates the array. The trim(adjustl(...)) function is used to remove any trailing spaces from the argument values.

the argValue array is allocated with a length of 100 characters, which should be sufficient to store most command-line arguments. You can adjust the length according to your specific needs.
